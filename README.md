# MES - Python Runtime for Students
Siena-MES is a Media Environment for Students. It is a pure python implementation of [gatech-csl/jes]([https://github.com/vuejs/vue](https://github.com/gatech-csl/jes)) with the goal to maintain API Parity between the implementations. This is a development environment designed for [Media Computation](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mjguz/mediacomp/mediaComp-teach/). The package can be imported into any Python 3.11 envornment to allow students to use the Python programming language to manipulate images, sounds, and videos. 
The current API documentation is consistent with the usage of JES in the book, and the subset of functions implemented so far is published here.
The library is developed for The Introduction to Computer Science (CSIS 110) course at Siena College and the college's high school CS programs.
